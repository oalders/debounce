## Introduction

debounce is a simple utility to limit the rate at which a command can fire.

The arguments are:

```bash
debounce <integer> <unit> <command>
```

Available units are:

* seconds (s)
* minutes (m)
* hours (h)

The following are equivalent:

```bash
debounce 1 s date
debounce 1 second date
debounce 1 seconds date
```

```bash
debounce 1 m date
debounce 1 minute date
debounce 1 minutes date
```

```bash
debounce 1 h date
debounce 1 hour date
debounce 1 hours date
```

## Examples

### A command without arguments

```bash
$ debounce 2 seconds date
Mon Aug  5 23:09:09 EDT 2024
$ debounce 2 seconds date
ðŸš¥ will not run date more than once every 2 seconds
```

### A command with arguments

This command uses <https://github.com/houseabsolute/ubi> to install
<https://github.com/oalders/is> into the current directory.  The command will
not be run more than once every 8 hours.

```bash
$ debounce 8 hours ubi --verbose --project oalders/is --in .
[ubi::installer][INFO] Installed binary into ./is
$ debounce 8 hours ubi --verbose --project oalders/is --in .
ðŸš¥ will not run "ubi --verbose --project oalders/is --in ." more than once every 8 hours
```

### Using Shell Variables

Remember to single quote variables which shouldn't be expanded until the
command is run.

```bash
debounce 10 s zsh -c 'echo $PWD'
```

### More Complex Commands

You can use `&&` and `||` in your commands. You'll want to quote your command
to ensure that the entire command is passed to `debounce`.

```bash
debounce 2 s bash -c 'sleep 2 && date'
```
